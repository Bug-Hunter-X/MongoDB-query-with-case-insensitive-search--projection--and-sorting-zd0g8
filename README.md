# MongoDB Query with Case-Insensitive Search, Projection, and Sorting

This example demonstrates a common MongoDB query with case-insensitive search using regular expressions, field projection, and sorting. It highlights potential issues that may arise, such as unexpected results or errors if not handled properly. 

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a function that executes a MongoDB query. This query performs a case-insensitive search for documents matching a specific pattern in the `name` field, projects only the `name` field in the output, and sorts the documents by age in descending order.  The potential error is in the construction of the query, in the case of incorrect regular expressions, which would lead to unexpected results.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to address potential issues that might occur in the query such as handling potential errors, validating input, or improving efficiency. Additional error handling and validation should be added to production code.

## Running the Code

1.  Make sure you have Node.js and a MongoDB instance running.
2.  Install the MongoDB driver: `npm install mongodb`
3.  Run the code using Node.js: `node bug.js` or `node bugSolution.js`

Remember to replace `<connection_string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string.  Consult the MongoDB documentation for details about creating and managing queries.
